# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a clearly visible "Generate Logo Concept" submit button to the Logo Concept Generator form.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a prominently labeled "Generate Logo Concept" submit button at the bottom of the Logo Concept Generator form
- Style the button with the app's gold accent color, consistent with other tool buttons
- Wire the button to trigger logo concept generation and render the 10-variant logo showcase
- Show a loading/disabled state on the button while generation is in progress

**User-visible outcome:** Users can now see and click a clearly visible "Generate Logo Concept" button in the Logo Concept Generator form to trigger logo generation.
