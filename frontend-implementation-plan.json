      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The application loads without a white screen, runtime error, or blank tool panel after navigating to the Logo Concept Generator.",
        "Submitting valid brand inputs (brand name, industry, tone) triggers logo concept generation and renders all 10 SVG logo variant cards in the 2-column grid without any card being blank or throwing a React error.",
        "Each of the 10 logo style variants displays the correct visual treatment as specified (Wordmark uses primary-color background, Lettermark uses initials in a circle, Gradient Wordmark uses a linearGradient fill, etc.).",
        "Each card's individual download button exports a PNG file of that specific SVG card.",
        "No other tool (Brand Name Generator, Marketing Content Generator, Sentiment Analyzer, Color Palette Generator, AI Branding Chatbot) is broken or visually degraded by the fix.",
        "The application builds and deploys to production without compile or runtime errors.",
        "useLogoRenderer.ts uses only basic SVG primitives and contains no complex path calculations or external dependencies that could cause build or performance issues."

Replace any unstable patterns, complex path calculations, or error-prone constructs with robust, lightweight equivalents. Ensure each variant renderer (Wordmark, Lettermark, Emblem, Icon+Wordmark, Monogram, Abstract Mark, Mascot-Style Badge, Stacked Wordmark, Negative Space Mark, Gradient Wordmark) returns valid SVG JSX that renders without throwing React errors. Add defensive checks for missing or malformed concept data."

          "description": "Audit and fix the LogoConceptGenerator component to ensure it renders all 10 logo variants in a 2-column grid layout without runtime errors. Fix any broken download-to-PNG logic in the per-card download buttons to ensure each button correctly exports a PNG file of its specific SVG card using client-side conversion (e.g., canvas-based approach or inline SVG serialization). Add error boundaries or null checks to prevent blank cards or white screens. Ensure the component handles loading, error, and success states gracefully and does not block rendering."
