        "The logo showcase section at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[2] displays exactly 10 distinct logo style variants after generating a logo concept",
        "All 10 variants are rendered as inline SVG elements using the brand name, primary color, secondary color, accent color, icon shape, and font style from the generated concept",
        "Each variant card is labeled with its style name (Wordmark, Lettermark, Emblem, Icon + Wordmark, Monogram, Abstract Mark, Mascot-Style Badge, Stacked Wordmark, Negative Space Mark, Gradient Wordmark)",
        "The 10 cards are displayed in a responsive 2-column grid layout",
        "Each card has its own download button that exports that card's SVG as a PNG file",

Update the JSX rendering logic to display all 10 logo style cards (Wordmark, Lettermark, Emblem, Icon + Wordmark, Monogram, Abstract Mark, Mascot-Style Badge, Stacked Wordmark, Negative Space Mark, Gradient Wordmark) in a responsive 2-column grid. Each card must render an inline SVG preview (approximately 300×180px), include a style name label below the preview, and provide an individual download button. Maintain the existing downloadLogoAsPng function to export each SVG card as a PNG file. Ensure the grid layout uses Tailwind CSS grid utilities (grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4) and that all brand inputs (brand name, primary color, secondary color, accent color, icon shape, font style) from the LogoConcept are passed to the rendering logic."

Add functions or mapping logic to generate inline SVG markup for each style: (1) Wordmark — brand name text on primary color background; (2) Lettermark — first 1–2 initials as large bold type in a circle using primary and accent colors; (3) Emblem — brand name inside a geometric badge/shield with icon symbol, using primary and secondary colors; (4) Icon + Wordmark — geometric icon beside brand name on dark background with gold accent; (5) Monogram — stacked/overlapping initials in a square frame using primary and secondary colors; (6) Abstract Mark — geometric SVG shape with brand name caption on accent color background; (7) Mascot-Style Badge — circular badge with icon at top, brand name in center, tagline placeholder at bottom, using all brand colors; (8) Stacked Wordmark — brand name split across two lines with SVG divider, on dark background with primary color accent; (9) Negative Space Mark — icon as white cutout on primary color background with brand name below; (10) Gradient Wordmark — brand name text filled with linear gradient (primary to secondary color) on dark background. Use only basic SVG primitives (rect, circle, polygon, text, line, linearGradient, clipPath). Return SVG markup or React elements for each style variant based on the LogoConcept fields (iconConcept, fontStyle, primaryColor, secondaryColors, logoStyle, backgroundStyle)."
