Style the button with gold accent background (bg-[oklch(var(--gold-accent))]), white text, rounded corners, padding, hover effects, and disabled state styling. Ensure the button is type='submit' so it triggers the existing handleSubmit handler. Add disabled={isLoading} to prevent multiple submissions and conditionally render a loading spinner or 'Generating...' text when isLoading is true. Position the button prominently with sufficient margin-top spacing from the form fields above it."
