  "summary": "The diff modifies LogoConceptGenerator.tsx, useLogoRenderer.ts, App.tsx, and supporting metadata files. The changes implement all 10 SVG logo variant renderers using basic SVG primitives via React.createElement, add exportToPNG helper, fix the LogoCard component with per-card download buttons, and restructure the component to render variants in a 2-column grid. The implementation appears to address the core REQ-14 requirements comprehensively.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-14",
      "requirement": "Each card's individual download button exports a PNG file of that specific SVG card.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated and the full implementation of exportToPNG in useLogoRenderer.ts is not visible. Without seeing the complete function body, it cannot be confirmed that PNG export logic is correctly implemented (canvas serialization, blob URL creation, download trigger).",

      "requirement": "Gradient Wordmark variant uses a linearGradient fill as specified.",
      "reason": "The useLogoRenderer.ts diff is truncated and only shows renderers up through a partial renderIconWordmark. The renderGradientWordmark function requiring linearGradient inside defs is not visible in the truncated content and cannot be confirmed as correctly implemented.",

      "requirement": "All 10 logo variant cards are rendered in a 2-column grid layout.",
      "reason": "The LogoConceptGenerator.tsx diff is truncated and the section where the 10 logo cards are mapped and rendered in a 2-column grid is not visible, so the grid layout implementation cannot be fully confirmed.",
