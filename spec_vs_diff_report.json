  "summary": "The diff implements most of the 8 requirements: all 6 tool components (REQ-1 through REQ-6), voice input via Web Speech API (REQ-7), and dark-themed sidebar layout (REQ-8). However, several specific acceptance criteria have gaps, particularly around the deterministic/rule-based backend logic, missing image assets, and a 7th tool discrepancy.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "The Brand Name Generator backend logic must be deterministic rule-based and avoid generic terms like Tech, Solutions, or Company — generation must reflect the provided inputs",
      "reason": "The backend in main.mo returns the same hardcoded static list of 15 names regardless of Industry, Keywords, or Brand Tone inputs. There is no rule-based logic tied to the inputs.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Each Instagram caption must include relevant hashtags and a call-to-action",
      "reason": "The backend returns static captions with hashtags but no explicit call-to-action per caption (e.g., 'Transform your brand #Innovation #Branding #Growth' has no CTA). The requirement specifies each caption must include a call-to-action.",

      "requirement": "Sentiment analysis must classify the review text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral based on the content with a 1-2 sentence explanation",
