  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-13 by adding a new useLogoRenderer.ts hook with all 10 logo style variants and updating LogoConceptGenerator.tsx to render a 2-column grid of 10 labeled SVG cards with individual download buttons. The implementation appears comprehensive and matches the specification closely.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-13",
      "requirement": "Each card must have an individual download button that exports that specific SVG card as a PNG file",
      "reason": "The download button in LogoVariantCard is labeled 'SVG' and calls exportToPNG from useLogoRenderer, but the visible button label says 'SVG' rather than 'PNG'. This raises a concern about whether the export actually produces a PNG file as required, or simply downloads the SVG string directly.",
