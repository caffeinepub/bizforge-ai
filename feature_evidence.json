      "featureTitle": "In the Logo Concept Generator tool (the card workspace at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[2]), replace the existing 4-variant multi-style logo showcase with an expanded 10-variant logo showcase. Render all 10 of the following logo style variants as inline SVG cards using the same brand inputs (brand name, primary color, secondary color, accent color, icon shape, font style): (1) Wordmark — brand name in recommended font, background filled with primary color, no icon; (2) Lettermark — first 1–2 initials as large bold type in a circle using primary and accent colors; (3) Emblem — brand name inside a geometric badge/shield shape with icon symbol, using primary and secondary colors; (4) Icon + Wordmark — geometric icon to the left of brand name text on dark background with gold accent; (5) Monogram — all initials stacked or overlapping in a square frame using primary and secondary colors; (6) Abstract Mark — a purely geometric/abstract SVG shape derived from the icon concept, with brand name as a small caption below, on accent color background; (7) Mascot-Style Badge — brand name inside a circular badge with a simple stylized icon at the top and a tagline placeholder at the bottom, using all brand colors; (8) Stacked Wordmark — brand name split into two lines with an SVG divider line between them, on a dark background with primary color accent; (9) Negative Space Mark — icon shape rendered as a cutout (white shape on primary color background) with brand name below; (10) Gradient Wordmark — brand name text filled with a linear gradient transitioning from primary to secondary color on a dark background. Display all 10 variants in a responsive 2-column grid of inline SVG cards (each approximately 300×180px), each labeled with its style name below the preview. Each card must have a individual download button that exports that specific SVG card as a PNG file.",
